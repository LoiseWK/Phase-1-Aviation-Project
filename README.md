# Aircraft Safety Risk Analysis

## Overview
This project is designed to help  the company expand into the aviation industry by identifying low-risk aircraft for acquisition. Using data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which covers aviation accidents from 1962 to 2023, the analysis evaluates aircraft based on accident frequency, fatality, and accident occurrence. The goal is to assess the safety of different aircraft types and recommend safer models for the business to focus on.

## 1.Business Understanding
**Stakeholders**

The primary stakeholder for this analysis is the Head of the Aviation Division, who is responsible for making decisions about aircraft acquisition for both commercial and private purposes.

**Key Business Questions**

1. Which aircraft types pose the lowest risk in terms of accident frequency?
2. Which aircraft types pose the lowest risk in terms of accident fatality?
3. Are there specific time periods when accidents are more frequent, requiring additional safety measures?
## 2.Data Understanding and Analysis

**Source of Data**

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which records aviation accidents and incidents. The data spans over 50 years, from 1962 to 2023, and focuses on civil aviation in the United States.

**Description of Data**

The dataset contains key attributes such as:
Aircraft Type: Identifying which types of aircraft were involved in accidents.
Accident Frequency: The total number of accidents recorded for each aircraft type.
Severity: Whether the accident was fatal or non-fatal.
Date: The month and year of each accident, allowing for the identification of seasonal trends.
Fatalities: The number of fatalities in each accident, providing insight into the safety risks posed by certain aircraft types.

## Visualizations:
Here are three key visualizations from the analysis that were instrumental in drawing conclusions:
1. Accident Frequency by Aircraft Type

This visualization highlights aircraft types with the highest number of accidents, such as Boeing 737 and Cessna 172.
2. Aircraft types with the most Fatalities

This visualization highlights aircraft types with the highest fatality rates, such as Boeing 737.
3. Seasonal Accident Trends

This chart demonstrates that accidents peak during the summer months like June ,July and August, indicating that additional safety measures should be implemented during these periods.

## Conclusion

The analysis provided several insights that will guide the company's decision-making process in entering the aviation industry.

High-Risk Aircraft: Aircraft like the Boeing 737 and Cessna 172 have a high frequency of accidents and should be avoided when making acquisition decisions. They represent a greater operational risk due to their history of accidents and fatalities.

Low-Risk Aircraft: Models such as MD Helicopters have significantly lower accident rates and minimal fatalities, making them safer options for purchase. These aircraft can help reduce operational hazards and insurance costs.

Seasonal Risks: The summer months, particularly June, July, and August, exhibit higher accident rates. The company should implement proactive safety protocols, such as increased maintenance checks and additional pilot training, during these high-risk months to mitigate# Phase-1-Aviation-Project
